                <h2>Getting to Dartmouth College</h2>
                <p>Dartmouth College is located in Hanover, New Hampshire, at the intersection of Interstates 89 and 91, along with NH/VT Routes 4 and 5. 
                    It is easily accessible by both bus and train -- by bus on the <a href="https://dartmouthcoach.com/route/upper-valley-to-boston-logan-airport/">Dartmouth Coach</a> 
                    from Boston, New York, and on <a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a> from Burlington, and by train on the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/vermonter-train">Vermonter Amtrak</a>, 
                    which runs from Washington, DC, to St. Albans, Vermont, and stops in White River Junction, a town neighboring Hanover. The closest 
                    major airport is Boston Logan International Airport, and closer regional airports include Burlington International Airport in Burlington, 
                    Vermont, Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. 
                </p>

                <h2>Staying in Hanover</h2>
                <p>There are a number of hotels in and near Hanover, including the Hanover Inn and Six South Street Hotel in downtown Hanover, the Norwich Inn 
                    in Norwich, Vermont, the Hilton Garden Inn and Best Western Hotel in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and the Hampton Inn in White River Junction.
                </p>

                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p class="before-p">We strongly recommend packing lunch. Dartmouth is fairly remote, the campus is spread out, and food is not always easily accessible. Inside the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center, which will house a large portion of the Olympiad's program,
                    eating is not permitted, and we ask that you follow guidelines around where to eat that will be made available before the event, and clean up after yourself.   
                </p>
                <p> If you do choose to purchase food in Hanover, eateries include The Class of 1953 Commons, Dartmouth College's main dining hall, along with restaurants such as Murphy's, Molly's, Base Camp 
                    Cafe, and Han Fusion in town. Cafes include Novack Cafe, Ramekin, and The Fern on campus, and Lou's, Dirty Cowboy Cafe, and My Brigadeiro in town.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Weather and Staying Warm</h2>
                <p>February brings cold, wintry weather to Hanover! Daily average temperatures for February hover at a balmy 25 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's not uncommon for it to be much colder, especially in the morning. As a result, being properly dressed for the cold is vitally important! We recommend layering, a technique for keeping warm that 
                    involves wearing multiple thinner layers of clothing (think a base shirt, a relatively thin fleece/pullover and then a thicker winter jacket) to allow you to regulate
                    your temperature throughout the day by adding on and taking off your "layers". We also recommend a fleece hat and/or a thick hood, along with thick gloves and/or mittens.
